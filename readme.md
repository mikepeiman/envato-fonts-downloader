A small script to save some click. For example, I curated over 400 fonts in a collection before paying for Envato, hoping I could bulk-download them. I could find no option for that, so I wrote this small script you can run in the browser console when you are logged in and on your fonts collections page.

Added pagination as well, it should detect number of pages and navigate through each page. 

However this is a very naive script, and will simply stop if it encounters an error. It was simply quick work to try to save some time creatively.
