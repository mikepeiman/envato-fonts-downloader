A small script to save some click. For example, I curated over 400 fonts in a collection before paying for Envato, hoping I could bulk-download them. I could find no option for that, so I wrote this small script you can run in the browser console when you are logged in and on your fonts collections page.

Didn't add pagination yet, you'll have to apply this code on each page of your collection.
